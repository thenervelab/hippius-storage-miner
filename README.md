## Requirements

- Ansible 2.9+
- Target hosts running Ubuntu 24.04
- SSH access to target hosts
- Root or sudo access on target hosts

## Server Requirements

### Ideal Server Specifications

To run both the Hippius blockchain node and IPFS with a ZFS pool efficiently, these are the recommended server specifications:

#### CPU
- **Minimum**: 4 dedicated cores (8 vCPUs)
- **Recommended**: 8+ dedicated cores (16+ vCPUs)
- **Reasoning**: The blockchain node needs consistent CPU performance for validation and processing. ZFS benefits from additional cores for checksumming and compression operations.

#### Memory (RAM)
- **Minimum**: 16GB
- **Recommended**: 32GB or more
- **Reasoning**: 
  - Blockchain nodes typically require 8-16GB RAM for optimal performance
  - ZFS is memory-hungry and benefits significantly from extra RAM for the ARC cache
  - IPFS can use substantial memory when handling many concurrent operations

#### Storage
- **System Disk**: 
  - SSD with 100GB+ for OS and applications

- **ZFS Pool for IPFS**:
  - **Minimum**: 2TB usable space
  - **Recommended**: 4TB+ usable space
  - **Disk Type**: NVMe SSDs or enterprise SSDs preferred for performance
  - **Configuration**: At least 2 disks for basic redundancy (mirror)
  - **ZFS ARC Cache**: Benefits greatly from additional RAM

- **Blockchain Data**: 
  - **Initial**: 100GB reserved, SSD-based storage
  - **Growth**: Plan for 50-100GB+ annual growth

#### Network
- **Bandwidth**: 1Gbps minimum, with at least 100Mbps sustained throughput
- **Monthly Traffic**: Plan for 5-10TB+ of monthly traffic (especially for IPFS)
- **Public IP**: Static public IP address recommended

#### Example Server Configurations

##### Mid-range Configuration
- 8 vCPUs
- 32GB RAM
- 100GB SSD for system
- 2x 2TB NVMe SSDs in ZFS mirror configuration (2TB usable)
- 1Gbps network connection

##### High-performance Configuration
- 16+ vCPUs
- 64GB RAM
- 200GB SSD for system
- 4x 2TB NVMe SSDs in RAID-Z/RAID10 configuration (6TB+ usable)
- 10Gbps network connection

## Components

### IPFS Node
- Runs as dedicated IPFS user
- ZFS storage pool for optimal performance
- Configurable API and gateway ports
- Systemd service for automatic startup

### Hippius Node
- Runs as root user
- Configured with off-chain worker support
- Default substrate ports (configurable)
- Systemd service for automatic startup
- Automatic ED25519 key management:
  - Uses provided key if specified in `hippius_key`
  - Generates a secure ED25519 key if none provided
  - Stores key in the network directory with proper permissions

## Usage

### Basic Deployment

1. Configure your inventory in `inventory/hosts`:
   ```
   [ipfs_nodes]
   your-server-ip-or-hostname
   ```

2. Review and adjust variables in `group_vars/all.yml`:
   - IPFS configuration and ZFS settings
   - Hippius binary location and ports

3. Run the playbook:
   ```bash
   ansible-playbook -i inventory/production/hosts.yml site.yml -e "hippius_hotkey_mnemonic='YOUR SEED WORDS'"
   ```

### ZFS Configuration

To use ZFS for IPFS storage, specify the available disks:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts site.yml -e "zfs_disks=['sdb','sdc']"
```

This creates a ZFS pool named "ipfs" using the specified disks.

### Running Only Hippius Role

To deploy or update only the Hippius node:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts site.yml --tags hippius
```

Or use the dedicated playbook:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts hippius.yml
```

### Updating Hippius Binary

To update just the Hippius binary without changing configuration:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts update_hippius.yml
```

### Injecting HIPS Key for Storage Mining

To inject your HIPS key for storage mining:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts inject_keys.yml -e "hippius_hotkey_mnemonic='word1 word2 ... word12'"
```

This will:
1. Connect to the already running Hippius node
2. Only inject the HIPS key required for storage mining
3. Verify the key was injected correctly

**Requirements:**
- The Hippius node must be running with RPC enabled
- No service interruption occurs during the key injection process

**Important**: Always protect your mnemonic phrase! Use single quotes around it to prevent shell expansion issues.

## Configuration

### Important Variables

```yaml
# ZFS Configuration for IPFS
zfs_disks: []  # Default empty, specify disk names like ['sdb','sdc']

# IPFS Configuration
ipfs_version: "v0.33.2"
ipfs_user: ipfs
ipfs_group: ipfs
ipfs_home: /zfs/ipfs    # ZFS dataset mountpoint
ipfs_data_dir: "{{ ipfs_home }}/data"
ipfs_api_address: "/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/5001"
ipfs_gateway_address: "/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/8080"

# Hippius Configuration
hippius_binary_url: "https://download.hippius.com/hippius"
hippius_home: /opt/hippius
hippius_data_dir: "{{ hippius_home }}/data"
hippius_key: ""  # Optional: Provide an existing ED25519 key in hex format
hippius_hotkey_mnemonic: ""  # Optional: Provide mnemonic for key injection
hippius_ports:
  rpc: 9944
  p2p: 30333
  ws: 9933
hippius_node_name: "hippius-storage-miner"
```

## Security Notes

- IPFS runs as a dedicated system user
- Hippius validator runs as root (as required)
- Firewall rules are automatically configured for all required ports

## Maintenance

### Service Management

```bash
# IPFS
systemctl status ipfs
systemctl restart ipfs

# Hippius
systemctl status hippius
systemctl restart hippius
```

### Viewing Node IDs

To display both the Hippius node ID and IPFS node ID:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts show_node_ids.yml
```

This command will output a formatted summary of node IDs that you can use for network identification and troubleshooting.

### ZFS Pool Management

```bash
# Check ZFS pool status
zpool status ipfs

# Check ZFS dataset space usage
zfs list

# Scrub ZFS pool (recommended monthly)
zpool scrub ipfs
```

## Troubleshooting

### Check service logs:
```bash
# IPFS logs
journalctl -u ipfs -f

# Hippius logs
journalctl -u hippius -f
```

### Common Issues

#### IPFS Not Starting
- Check permissions: `ls -la /zfs/ipfs`
- Verify ZFS mounts: `zfs list`
- Check IPFS config: `cat /zfs/ipfs/data/config`

#### Hippius Not Connecting to Network
- Check bootnodes configuration
- Verify firewall settings: `ufw status`
- Check Hippius logs for specific errors




## Update only the ipfs storage:

ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts site.yml --tags ipfs-storage-max
